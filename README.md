# NVIDIA RecSys Examples

# Overview
NVIDIA RecSys Examples is a collection of optimized recommender models and components. 

The project includes:
- Examples for large-scale HSTU ranking and retrieval models through [TorchRec](https://github.com/pytorch/torchrec) and [Megatron-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) integration
- HSTU (Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit) attention operator support
- Dynamic Embeddings with GPU acceleration

# Get Started

Before running examples, build and install libs under corelib following instruction in documentation:
- [HSTU attention documentation](./corelib/hstu/README.md)
- [Dynamic Embeddings documentation](./corelib/dynamicemb/README.md)

On top of those two core libs, Megatron-Core along with other libs are required. You can install them via pypi package:

```bash
pip install torchx gin-config torchmetrics==1.0.3 typing-extensions iopath megatron-core==0.9.0
```

If you fail to install the megatron-core package, usually due to the python version incompatibility, please try to clone and then install the source code. 

```bash
git clone -b core_r0.9.0 https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git megatron-lm && \
pip install -e ./megatron-lm
```

The examples we supported:
- [HSTU recommender examples](./examples/hstu/README.md)
