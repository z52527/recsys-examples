# NVIDIA RecSys Examples

# Overview
NVIDIA RecSys Examples is a collection of optimized recommender models and components. 

The project includes:
- Examples for large-scale HSTU ranking and retrieval models through [TorchRec](https://github.com/pytorch/torchrec) and [Megatron-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) integration
- HSTU (Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit) attention operator support
- Dynamic Embeddings with GPU acceleration

# What's New

- **[2025/9/8]** 🎉v25.08 released!
  - Added cache support for dynamicemb, enabling seamless hot embedding migration between cache and storage.
  - Released an end-to-end HSTU inference example, demonstrating precision aligned with training.
  - Enabled evaluation mode support for dynamicemb.
- **[2025/8/1]** 🎉v25.07 released!
  - Released HSTU inference benchmark, including paged kvcache HSTU kernel, kvcache manager based on trt-llm, CUDA graph, and other optimizations.
  - Added support for Tensor Parallelism in the HSTU layer.
- **[2025/7/4]** 🎉v25.06 released!
  - Dynamicemb lookup module performance improvement and LFU eviction support. 
  - Pipeline support for HSTU example, recompute support for HSTU layer and customized cuda ops for jagged tensor concat.

- **[2025/5/29]** 🎉v25.05 released! 
  - Enhancements to the dynamicemb functionality, including support for EmbeddingBagCollection, truncated normal initialization, and initial_accumulator_value for Adagrad.
  - Fusion of operations like layernorm and dropout in the HSTU layer, resulting in about 1.2x end-to-end speedup.
  - Fix convergence issues on the Kuairand dataset.

# Environment Setup
## Start from dockerfile

We provide [dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) for users to build environment. 
```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --platform linux/amd64 -t recsys-examples:latest .
```
If you want to build image for Grace, you can use 
```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile --platform linux/arm64 -t recsys-examples:latest .
```
You can also set your own base image with args `--build-arg <BASE_IMAGE>`.

## Start from source file
Before running examples, build and install libs under corelib following instruction in documentation:
- [HSTU attention documentation](./corelib/hstu/README.md)
- [Dynamic Embeddings documentation](./corelib/dynamicemb/README.md)

On top of those two core libs, Megatron-Core along with other libs are required. You can install them via pypi package:

```bash
pip install torchx gin-config torchmetrics==1.0.3 typing-extensions iopath megatron-core==0.9.0
```

If you fail to install the megatron-core package, usually due to the python version incompatibility, please try to clone and then install the source code. 

```bash
git clone -b core_r0.9.0 https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git megatron-lm && \
pip install -e ./megatron-lm
```

We provide our custom HSTU CUDA operators for enhanced performance. You need to install these operators using the following command:

```bash
cd /workspace/recsys-examples/examples/hstu && \
python setup.py install
```
