## DynamicEmbParameterConstraints

The `DynamicEmbParameterConstraints` function inherits from TorchREC's `ParameterConstraints` function. It has the same basic parameters as `ParameterConstraints` and adds members for specifying and configuring dynamic embedding tables. This function serves as the only entry point for users to specify whether an embedding table is a dynamic embedding table..

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.planner import DynamicEmbParameterConstraints

    #API arguments
    @dataclass
    class DynamicEmbParameterConstraints(ParameterConstraints):
        """
        DynamicEmb-specific parameter constraints that extend ParameterConstraints.

        Attributes
        ----------
        use_dynamicemb : Optional[bool]
            A flag indicating whether to use DynamicEmb storage. Defaults to False.
        dynamicemb_options : Optional[DynamicEmbTableOptions]
            Configuration for the dynamic embedding table, including initializer args.
            Common choices include "uniform", "normal", etc. Defaults to "uniform".
        """
        use_dynamicemb: Optional[bool] = False
        dynamicemb_options: Optional[DynamicEmbTableOptions] = DynamicEmbTableOptions()

    ```

## DynamicEmbeddingEnumerator

The `DynamicEmbeddingEnumerator` function inherits from TorchREC's `EmbeddingEnumerator` function and its usage is exactly the same as `EmbeddingEnumerator`. This class differentiates between TorchREC's embedding tables and dynamic embedding tables during enumeration in the sharding plan.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.planner import DynamicEmbeddingEnumerator

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbeddingEnumerator(EmbeddingEnumerator):
    def __init__(
        self,
        topology: Topology,
        batch_size: Optional[int] = BATCH_SIZE,
        #TODO:check the input type is DynamicEmbParameterConstraints or ParameterConstraints
        constraints: Optional[Dict[str, DynamicEmbParameterConstraints]] = None,
        estimator: Optional[Union[ShardEstimator, List[ShardEstimator]]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        """
        DynamicEmbeddingEnumerator extends the EmbeddingEnumerator to handle dynamic embedding tables.

        Parameters
        ----------
        topology : Topology
            The topology of the GPU and Host memory.
        batch_size : Optional[int], optional
            The batch size for training. Defaults to BATCH_SIZE.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
        constraints : Optional[Dict[str, DynamicEmbParameterConstraints]], optional
            A dictionary of constraints for the parameters. Defaults to None.
        estimator : Optional[Union[ShardEstimator, List[ShardEstimator]]], optional
            An estimator or a list of estimators for estimating shard sizes. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
        """
    ```

## DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner

Wrapped TorchREC's `EmbeddingShardingPlanner` to perform sharding for dynamic embedding tables. Unlike `EmbeddingShardingPlanner`, it requires an additional `eb_configs` argument so DynamicEmb can derive per-rank capacities and bucket widths from the global `EmbeddingConfig` and the process-group world size.

On construction it runs the internal preparation step described under [Sharding planner](#sharding-planner), then builds the TorchREC sub-planner and DynamicEmb shard metadata as before.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.planner import DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner:
    def __init__(self,
        eb_configs: List[BaseEmbeddingConfig],
        topology: Optional[Topology] = None,
        batch_size: Optional[int] = None,
        enumerator: Optional[Enumerator] = None,
        storage_reservation: Optional[StorageReservation] = None,
        proposer: Optional[Union[Proposer, List[Proposer]]] = None,
        partitioner: Optional[Partitioner] = None,
        performance_model: Optional[PerfModel] = None,
        stats: Optional[Union[Stats, List[Stats]]] = None,
        constraints: Optional[Dict[str, DynamicEmbParameterConstraints]] = None,
        debug: bool = True):

        """
        DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner wraps EmbeddingShardingPlanner and adds `eb_configs` (TorchREC
        table configs) so per-rank DynamicEmb options can be filled before planning. See the
        "Sharding planner" section in DynamicEmb_APIs.md for how `DynamicEmbTableOptions` are adjusted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        eb_configs : List[BaseEmbeddingConfig]
            A list of TorchREC BaseEmbeddingConfig in the TorchREC model
        topology : Optional[Topology], optional
            The topology of GPU and Host memory. If None, a default topology will be created. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
            Note: The memory budget does not include the consumption of dynamicemb.
        batch_size : Optional[int], optional
            The batch size for training. Defaults to None, will set 512 in Planner.
        enumerator : Optional[Enumerator], optional
            An enumerator for sharding. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.

            Storage reservation details. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
        proposer : Optional[Union[Proposer, List[Proposer]]], optional
            A proposer or a list of proposers for proposing sharding plans. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
        partitioner : Optional[Partitioner], optional
            A partitioner for partitioning the embedding tables. Defaults to None.
            The creation and usage are consistent with the same types in TorchREC.
        performance_model : Optional[PerfModel], optional
            A performance model for evaluating sharding plans. Defaults to None.

        debug : bool, optional
            A flag indicating whether to enable debug mode. Defaults to True.
        """
    ```

## Sharding planner

When you construct `DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner`, the implementation first validates that `constraints` and `eb_configs` are consistent (every `EmbeddingCollection` / table name appears exactly once in `eb_configs`, matches the keys of `constraints`, and there are no extra keys). Then, **for each table with** `DynamicEmbParameterConstraints.use_dynamicemb == True`, it updates that table’s `DynamicEmbTableOptions` in **`dynamicemb_options`** via the internal routine `_prepare_dynemb_table_options` (order matters):

| Step | Field(s) | What happens |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | `initializer_args` | **`complete_initializer_args`** returns a new `DynamicEmbInitializerArgs` when needed. For **`UNIFORM`** initialization only: if `lower` or `upper` is `None`, they are filled. With a TorchREC `embedding_config`, bounds are `±sqrt(1 / num_embeddings)`; without it, `0.0` and `1.0`. Other modes are returned unchanged. |
| 2 | `bucket_capacity`, `max_capacity` | **`_sharded_table_bucket_layout(embedding_config, world_size, bucket_capacity)`** (internal) returns **`(num_buckets, effective_bucket_width)`** per rank. The planner overwrites **`bucket_capacity`** with the **effective** width (after `MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY` / alignment rules). **`max_capacity`** is set to **`num_buckets * effective_bucket_width`**, i.e. the same value as **`get_sharded_table_capacity(embedding_config, world_size, bucket_capacity)`**. **`init_capacity`**: if unset, set to **`max_capacity`**; if set, align to **`bucket_capacity`**, then clamp to **`max_capacity`** if larger. **User input:** `bucket_capacity` on `DynamicEmbTableOptions` (multiple of **`BUCKET_ALIGNMENT` (16)** unless **`MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY`** = `2**63 - 1`). **Sentinel:** layout is `(1, aligned_per_rank_rows)` — one bucket spanning the shard. **Otherwise:** `num_buckets = align_to_table_size(ceil(N/world), bucket_capacity) // bucket_capacity`. |
| 3 | `local_hbm_for_values` | Overwritten to **`ceil(global_hbm_for_values / world_size)`** so each rank gets an equal byte budget from the user-provided **`global_hbm_for_values`** (set on `DynamicEmbTableOptions` before planning). |

**User-supplied values that should be set before planning** (typical DMP path) include at least:

- **`global_hbm_for_values`**: global HBM byte budget for the table’s values; the planner only splits it across ranks.
- **`bucket_capacity`**: requested hashtable bucket size in rows (see rules above), or `MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY` for “single bucket per rank table”.
- **`initializer_args`**: optional partial bounds for `UNIFORM`; missing bounds are completed as in step 1.

**Downstream (after planning, when modules are built):** the batched embedding path uses **`max_capacity`** from **`DynamicEmbTableOptions`** (e.g. allocation size and consistency checks against TorchREC shard row counts in `_get_dynamicemb_options_per_table` in `batched_dynamicemb_compute_kernel.py`).

**Public helpers** (same rules as the planner):

- `from dynamicemb.dynamicemb_config import complete_initializer_args` (initializer completion; not re-exported from `dynamicemb` top-level today)
- `from dynamicemb import get_sharded_table_capacity` — returns **per-rank row capacity** after sharding and bucket alignment (``num_buckets * effective_bucket_width``), matching **`max_capacity`** set by the planner. With **`MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY`**, the table is one bucket per rank whose width is the aligned shard row count.
- `from dynamicemb import get_table_value_bytes` — total bytes for **all ranks**’ value storage (embedding + optimizer state rows), using the same row layout as `get_sharded_table_capacity` for the given `bucket_capacity` (including **`MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY`**). Use this to size **`global_hbm_for_values`** before planning; apply your own **caching** fraction or **HBM budget scale** on top if needed (as in benchmarks / examples).
- `from dynamicemb import BUCKET_ALIGNMENT, MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY`

## DynamicEmbeddingCollectionSharder

Inherits from TorchREC's `EmbeddingCollectionSharder` and is used in exactly the same way. This API mainly overrides the deduplication process of indices through inheritance, making it compatible with dynamic embedding tables.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.shard import DynamicEmbeddingCollectionSharder
    ```

## DynamicEmbCheckMode

When the dynamic embedding table capacity is small, a single feature with a large number of indices may lead to issues where the hashtable cannot insert the indices. Enabling safe check allows you to observe this behavior (the number of times indices cannot be inserted and the number of indices each time) to determine if the dynamic embedding table capacity is set too low.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbCheckMode

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbCheckMode(enum.IntEnum):
        """
        Enumeration for different modes of checking dynamic embedding's insertion behaviors.
        DynamicEmb uses a hashtable as the backend. If the embedding table capacity is small and the number of indices in a single feature is large,
        it is easy for too many indices to be allocated to the same hash table bucket in one lookup, resulting in the inability to insert indices into the hashtable.
        DynamicEmb resolves this issue by setting the lookup results of indices that cannot be inserted to 0.
        Fortunately, in a hashtable with a large capacity, such insertion failures are very rare and almost never occur.
        This issue is more frequent in hashtables with small capacities, which can affect training accuracy.
        Therefore, we do not recommend using dynamic embedding tables for very small embedding tables.

        To prevent this behavior from affecting training without user awareness, DynamicEmb provides a safe check mode.
        Users can set whether to enable safe check when configuring DynamicEmbTableOptions.
        Enabling safe check will add some overhead, but it can provide insights into whether the hash table frequently fails to insert indices.
        If the number of insertion failures is high and the proportion of affected indices is large,
        it is recommended to either increase the dynamic embedding capacity or avoid using dynamic embedding tables for small embedding tables.

        Attributes
        ----------
        ERROR : int
            When there are indices that can't be inserted successfully:
                This mode will throw a runtime error indicating how many indices failed to insert.
                The program will crash.
        WARNING : int
            When there are indices that can't be inserted successfully:
                This mode will give a warning about how many indices failed to insert.
                The program will continue. For uninserted indices, their embeddings' values will be set to 0.0.
        IGNORE : int
            Don't check whether insertion is successful or not, therefore it doesn't bring additional checking overhead.
            For uninserted indices, their embeddings' values will be set to 0.0 silently.
        """
        ERROR = 0
        WARNING = 1
        IGNORE = 2

    ```

## DynamicEmbInitializerMode

The initialization method for each embedding vector in the dynamic embedding table currently supports random UNIFORM distribution, random NORMAL distribution, and non-random constant initialization. The default distribution is UNIFORM.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbInitializerMode

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbInitializerMode(enum.Enum):
        """
        Enumeration for different modes of initializing dynamic embedding vector values.

        Attributes
        ----------
        NORMAL : str
            Normal Distribution.
        UNIFORM : str
            Uniform distribution of random values.
        CONSTANT : str
            All dynamic embedding vector values are a given constant.
        DEBUG : str
            Debug value generation mode for testing.
        """
        NORMAL = "normal"
        TRUNCATED_NORMAL = "truncated_normal"
        UNIFORM = "uniform"
        CONSTANT = "constant"
        DEBUG = "debug"
    ```

## DynamicEmbInitializerArgs

Parameters for each random initialization method in DynamicEmbInitializerMode.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbInitializerArgs

    #API arguments
    @dataclass
    class DynamicEmbInitializerArgs:
        """
        Arguments for initializing dynamic embedding vector values.

        Attributes
        ----------

        mean : float, optional
            The mean value for normal distributions. Defaults to 0.0.
        std_dev : float, optional
            The standard deviation for normal and distributions. Defaults to 1.0.
        lower : float, optional
            The lower bound for uniform distribution. Defaults to 0.0.
        upper : float, optional
            The upper bound for uniform distribution. Defaults to 1.0.
        value : float, optional
            The constant value for constant initialization. Defaults to 0.0.
        """
        mode: DynamicEmbInitializerMode
        mean: float = 0.0
        std_dev: float = 1.0
        lower: float = None
        upper: float = None
        value: float = 0.0
    ```

## DynamicEmbScoreStrategy

The storage space is limited, but the value range of sparse features is relatively large, 
so dynamicemb introduces the concept of score to perform customized eviction of sparse features within the limited storage space.
dynamicemb provides the following strategies to set the score.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbScoreStrategy

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbScoreStrategy(enum.IntEnum):
        """
        Enumeration for different modes to set index-embedding's score.
        The index-embedding pair with smaller scores will be more likely to be evicted from the embedding table when the table is full.

        dynamicemb allows configuring scores by table.
        For a table, the scores in the subsequent forward passes are larger than those in the previous ones for modes TIMESTAMP and STEP.
        Users can also provide customized score(mode CUSTOMIZED) for each table's forward pass.
        Attributes
        ----------
        TIMESTAMP:
            In a forward pass, embedding table's scores will be set to global nanosecond timer of device, and due to the timing of GPU scheduling,
            different scores may have slight differences.
            Users must not set scores under TIMESTAMP mode.
        STEP:
            Each embedding table has a member `step` which will increment for every forward pass.
            All scores in each forward pass are the same which is step's value.
            Users must not set scores under STEP mode.
        CUSTOMIZED:
            Each embedding table's score are managed by users.
            Users have to set the score before every forward pass using `set_score` interface.
        LFU:
            If there are not enough slots inside the bucket to store new keys, the least used key in the bucket will be evicted.
        NO_EVICTION:
            The table’s capacity doubles whenever there are not enough slots for new keys, and this continues until available memory is exhausted.
            When the memory resources are insufficient, there will be a warning message, and training can continue but the accuracy of eviction cannot be guaranteed.
        """

        TIMESTAMP = 0
        STEP = 1
        CUSTOMIZED = 2
        LFU = 3
        NO_EVICTION = 4
    ```

    Users can specify the `DynamicEmbScoreStrategy` using `score_strategy` in `DynamicEmbTableOptions` per table.

## DynamicEmbPoolingMode

DynamicEmb supports three pooling modes that determine how embedding lookups are aggregated. These modes correspond to how `EmbeddingCollection` (sequence) and `EmbeddingBagCollection` (pooled) work in TorchREC.

All pooling modes use fused CUDA kernels for both forward and backward passes. Tables with different embedding dimensions (mixed-D) are fully supported in `SUM` and `MEAN` modes.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbPoolingMode

    #API arguments
    class DynamicEmbPoolingMode(enum.IntEnum):
        """
        Enumeration for pooling modes in dynamic embedding lookup.

        Attributes
        ----------
        SUM : int
            Sum pooling. For each sample, the embeddings of all indices in the bag
            are summed. Output shape: (batch_size, total_D) where total_D is the
            sum of embedding dimensions across all features.
        MEAN : int
            Mean pooling. For each sample, the embeddings of all indices in the bag
            are averaged. Output shape: same as SUM.
        NONE : int
            No pooling (sequence mode). Each index produces its own embedding row.
            Output shape: (total_indices, D).
        """
        SUM = 0
        MEAN = 1
        NONE = 2
    ```

## DynamicEmbTableOptions

Per-table configuration for dynamic embedding, passed into `DynamicEmbParameterConstraints` as `dynamicemb_options`. The authoritative definition lives in `dynamicemb.dynamicemb_config.DynamicEmbTableOptions` (this section mirrors its docstring).

Fields declared first (through `device_id`) are **planner/runtime-heavy**: `DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner` fills them via `_prepare_dynemb_table_options` together with internal `_sharded_table_bucket_layout` (and thus the same per-rank row count as `get_sharded_table_capacity`). User-facing knobs such as `training`, `bucket_capacity`, `global_hbm_for_values`, and `initializer_args` follow. Hash-table **scores** are driven by `score_strategy` and kernels, not by a separate score-dtype field on this dataclass.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb import DynamicEmbTableOptions

    #API arguments
    @dataclass
    class DynamicEmbTableOptions:
        """
        Encapsulates the configuration options for dynamic embedding table.

        This class includes parameters that control the behavior and performance of the embedding lookup module, specifically tailored for dynamic embeddings.
        `get_grouped_key` will return fields used to group dynamic embedding tables.

        Fields listed first (through ``device_id``) are often filled by the planner or runtime rather than
        being the main user configuration knobs. Score handling for the hash table follows score
        policies and kernels, not a separate score-dtype field on this dataclass.

        Parameters
        ----------
        embedding_dtype : Optional[torch.dtype], optional
            Data (weight) type of dynamic embedding table.
        dim : Optional[int], optional
            Value vector dimension. With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``, ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options``
            sets it from ``BaseEmbeddingConfig.embedding_dim``. The embedding kernel only warns if it
            differs from the sharded ``local_cols`` (see ``_get_dynamicemb_options_per_table``).
        max_capacity : Optional[int], optional
            Per-shard maximum table rows on one GPU. With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``,
            ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options`` sets ``max_capacity`` to
            per-rank row count from ``get_sharded_table_capacity``.
            You may omit ``max_capacity`` on ``DynamicEmbTableOptions`` before planning and let the planner set it.
            If ``init_capacity`` is unset it becomes ``max_capacity``; if set and aligned,
            it is clamped to at most ``max_capacity``.
            The embedding kernel checks consistency with TorchREC shard metadata (see
            ``_get_dynamicemb_options_per_table``).
        evict_strategy : DynamicEmbEvictStrategy
            Strategy used for evicting entries when the table exceeds its capacity.
            Default is ``DynamicEmbEvictStrategy.LRU``.
        local_hbm_for_values : int
            High-bandwidth memory allocated for local values, in bytes. Default is 0.
            With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``, this is set to
            ``ceil(global_hbm_for_values / world_size)`` per rank.
        device_id : Optional[int], optional
            CUDA device index.
        training: bool
            Flag to indicate dynamic embedding tables is working on training mode or evaluation mode, default to `True`.
            If in training mode. **dynamicemb** stores embeddings and optimizer states together in the underlying key-value table. e.g.
                key:torch.int64
                value = torch.concat(embedding, opt_states, dim=1)

            Therefore, if `training=True` the module allocates memory for optimizer states; the per-row state size follows the `optimizer` entry in `fused_params` (FBGEMM `EmbOptimType`), as used by `BatchedDynamicEmbeddingTablesV2`.
        initializer_args : DynamicEmbInitializerArgs
            Arguments for initializing dynamic embedding vector values when training, and default using uniform distribution.
            For ``UNIFORM`` and ``TRUNCATED_NORMAL``, ``lower`` and ``upper`` default to
            ``±1/sqrt(N)`` where ``N`` is ``EmbeddingConfig.num_embeddings``.
        eval_initializer_args: DynamicEmbInitializerArgs
            The initializer args for evaluation mode, and will return torch.zeros(...) as embedding by default if index/sparse feature is missing.
        caching: bool
            Flag to indicate dynamic embedding tables is working on caching mode, default to `False`.
            When the device memory on a single GPU is insufficient to accommodate a single shard of the dynamic embedding table, 
                dynamicemb supports the mixed use of device memory and host memory(pinned memory).
            But by default, the values of the entire table are concatenated with device memory and host memory.
            This means that the storage location of one embedding is determined by `hash_function(key)`, and mapping to device memory will bring better lookup performance.
            However, sparse features in training are often with temporal locality.
            In order to store hot keys in device memory, dynamicemb creates two table instances, 
                whose values are stored in device memory and host memory respectively, and store hot keys on the GPU table priorily. 
            If the GPU table is full, the evicted keys will be inserted into the host table.
            If the host table is also full, the key will be evicted(all the eviction is based on the score per key). 
            The original intention of eviction is based on this insight: features that only appear once should not occupy memory(even host memory) for a long time.
            In short:
                set **`caching=True`** will create a GPU table and a host table, and make GPU table serves as a cache;
                set **`caching=False`** will create a hybrid table which use GPU and host memory in a concatenated way to store value.
                All keys and other meta data are always stored on GPU for both cases.
        init_capacity : Optional[int], optional
            The initial capacity of the table. If not set, it defaults to max_capacity after sharding.
            ``BatchedDynamicEmbeddingTablesV2`` also sets ``init_capacity`` to ``max_capacity`` when it is still ``None``.
            If `init_capacity` is provided, it will serve as the initial table capacity on a single GPU.
            With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``, it is rounded up to a multiple of the effective
            ``bucket_capacity`` in ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options``, then capped at ``max_capacity`` if the aligned value is larger.
            As the `load_factor` of the table increases, its capacity will gradually double (rehash) until it reaches `max_capacity`.
            Rehash will be done implicitly.
            Note: This is the setting for a single table at each rank.
        max_load_factor : float
            The maximum load factor before rehashing occurs. Default is 0.5.
            In NO_EVICTION mode, this option is ignored: the implementation uses a fixed effective max load factor of 0.5 for the key_index_map (initial sizing and expansion). See the "Table expansion" section for NO_EVICTION trigger conditions.
        score_strategy(DynamicEmbScoreStrategy):
            dynamicemb gives each key-value pair a score to represent its importance.
            Once there is insufficient space, the key-value pair will be evicted based on the score.
            The `score_strategy` is used to configure how to set the scores for keys in each batch.
            Default to DynamicEmbScoreStrategy.TIMESTAMP.
            For the multi-GPUs scenario of model parallelism, every rank's score_strategy should keep the same for one table,
                as they are the same table, but stored on different ranks.
        bucket_capacity : int
            Capacity of each bucket in the hash table, and default is 128 (using 1024 when the table serves as cache).
            A key will only be mapped to one bucket. 
            When the bucket is full, the key with the smallest score in the bucket will be evicted, and its slot will be used to store a new key. 
            The larger the bucket capacity, the more accurate the score based eviction will be, but it will also result in performance loss.
        safe_check_mode : DynamicEmbCheckMode
            Used to check if all keys in the current batch have been successfully inserted into the table.
            Should dynamic embedding table insert safe check be enabled? By default, it is disabled.
            Please refer to the API documentation for DynamicEmbCheckMode for more information.
        global_hbm_for_values : int
            Total GPU memory allocated to store embedding + optimizer states, in bytes. Default is 0.
            It has different meanings under `caching=True` and  `caching=False`.
                When `caching=False`, it decides how much GPU memory is in the total memory to store value in a single hybrid table.
                When `caching=True`, it decides the table capacity of the GPU table.
            To match planner row counts and optimizer state width, size the **global** budget with
            ``get_table_value_bytes(embedding_config, EmbOptimType, world_size, bucket_capacity)``
            (same ``bucket_capacity`` you pass into ``get_sharded_table_capacity``, e.g. ``128`` or ``MAX_BUCKET_CAPACITY``),
            then multiply by a cache ratio or scale if desired. The planner overwrites **per-rank**
            ``local_hbm_for_values`` to ``ceil(global_hbm_for_values / world_size)``.
        external_storage: Storage
            The external storage/ParamterServer which inherits the interface of Storage, and can be configured per table.
            If not provided, will using DynamicEmbeddingTable as the Storage.
        index_type : Optional[torch.dtype], optional
            Index type of sparse features, will be set to DEFAULT_INDEX_TYPE(torch.int64) by default.
        admit_strategy : Optional[AdmissionStrategy], optional
            Admission strategy for controlling which keys are allowed to enter the embedding table.
            If provided, only keys that meet the strategy's criteria will be inserted into the table.
            Keys that don't meet the criteria will still be initialized and used in the forward pass,
            but won't be stored in the table. Default is None (all keys are admitted).
        admission_counter : Optional[Counter], optional
            Counter for tracking the number of keys that have been admitted to the embedding table.
            If provided, the counter will be used to track the number of keys that have been admitted to the embedding table.
            Default is None (no counter is used).

## incremental_dump {#incremental_dump}

**Background**
In recommendation systems, an incremental dump refers to the process of exporting or updating only the new or changed data since the last data dump, rather than exporting the entire dataset each time. The background for using incremental dumps is that recommendation systems often operate on massive and continuously growing datasets, such as user interactions, item updates, and behavioral logs. Performing a full data dump frequently would be inefficient and resource-intensive, consuming significant storage and processing power.

**Target**
The main purpose of incremental dump is to improve efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and transferred during each update cycle. This allows the recommendation system to stay up-to-date with the latest data changes while minimizing downtime, storage usage, and computational overhead. Incremental dumps enable faster data refresh and model retraining, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant and timely in dynamic, large-scale environments.


**Behavior**
Given a model contains one or more `ShardedDynamicEmbeddingCollection`, this API will dump the eligible indices and embeddings of all ranks, based on the input `score_threshold`.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.incremental_dump import incremental_dump

    #API arguments
    def incremental_dump(
        model: torch.nn.Module,

    ) -> Union[
        Tuple[
            Dict[str, Dict[str, Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]]],

            pg(Optional[dist.ProcessGroup]): optional. The process group used to control the communication scope in the dump. Defaults to None.

        Returns
        -------

    ```

More usage please see [test](https://github.com/NVIDIA/recsys-examples/blob/main/corelib/dynamicemb/test/unit_tests/incremental_dump/test_distributed_dynamicemb.py)

## get_score

dynamicemb also provides a `get_score` interface whose returns are the current scores which will be used in the next forward pass. 
Users can use get_score’s returns at an earlier time and use it as a threshold for the later incremental dump. 
It's recommended for TIMESTAMP and STEP mode, and can also be used under CUSTOMIZED mode, but please note that get_score will only return the scores used in the next forward.
Under CUSTOMIZED mode, users need to understand the meaning of get_score's returns,  and dynamicemb is not responsible for managing the score any more.  For example, if users call get_score firstly to get the threshold, then decrease the score later to train the model, and finally call incremental_dump using the previous larger threshold, it will not dump anything.

    ```python
    #How to import
    from dynamicemb.incremental_dump import get_score

    #API arguments
    def get_score(model: torch.nn.Module) -> Union[Dict[str, Dict[str, int]], None]:
        """Get score for each dynamic embediing table.

                    * CUSTOMIZED mode: score set in last forward pass
                - Returns None if no dynamic embedding tables exist or scores unavailable
        """
    ```

## set_score

Under CUSTOMIZED mode, users have to set the scores for each table.
Users can set the scores one time and use it repeatedly in the several forward passes later.
Generally speaking, the score increases as training progresses, and dynamicemb will throw a warning when the new score is less than the old one.
Setting the environment variable DYNAMICEMB_CSTM_SCORE_CHECK to 0 will not throw the warnings.

## Counter

**dynamicemb** also provides a built-in counter implementation named `KVCounter`.
There is as capacity limit of `KVCounter` which is bucketized, and the key with the smallest frequency will be evicted from the bucket for a new key if the bucket is full. 

```python

class KVCounter(Counter):

    )
```

## AdmissionStrategy

**AdmissionStrategy** is another component for implementing embedding admission.
The keys not in the dynamic embedding table, will first be passed to the `Counter`, after get the accumulated frequencies among the previous training process, the `AdmissionStrategy` will determine which keys will be admitted into the dynamic embedding table.

```python
class AdmissionStrategy(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def admit(
        self,
        keys: torch.Tensor,
        frequencies: torch.Tensor,

# Functionality and User interface

## Distributed embedding training and evaluation

Once the model containing `EmbeddingCollection` is built and initialized through `DistributedModelParallel`, it can be trained and evaluated on each GPU like a single GPU, with torchrec completing communication between different GPUs.

The switching between training and evaluation modes should be consistent with `nn.Module`, while `training` in [DynamicEmbTableOptions](./dynamicemb/dynamicemb_config.py) is used to guide whether to allocate memory to optimizer states when builds the table.

Due to limited resources, the dynamic embedding table does not pre allocate memory for all keys. If a key appears for the first time during training, it will be initialized immediately during the training process. Please see `initializer_args` and `eval_initializer_args` in `DynamicEmbTableOptions` for more information.

## Automatic eviction

The size of the table is finite, but the set of keys during training may be infinite. dynamicemb provides the function of automatic eviction, which constrains the size of tables reasonably when there is no available space. See `score_strategy` and `bucket_capacity` for more information.

## Caching and prefetch

dynamicemb supports caching hot embeddings on GPU memory, and you can prefetch keys from host to device like torchrec. Caching and prefetch work for both sequence mode (`NONE`) and pooling modes (`SUM`/`MEAN`). See `test_prefetch_flush_in_cache` in [test prefetch](./test/test_batched_dynamic_embedding_tables_v2.py) for usage examples.

## External storage

dynamicemb supports external storage once `external_storage` in `DynamicEmbTableOptions` inherits the `Storage` interface under [types.py](./dynamicemb/types.py). 
Refer to demo `PyDictStorage` in [unit test](./test/test_batched_dynamic_embedding_tables_v2.py) for detailed usage.


## Table expansion

Users can specify the initial capacity of a table on a single GPU. When the table needs more space, the implementation may double the key_index_map and embedding table capacity (per table, only for tables that need it) before insert. Expansion is triggered in these paths so that insert does not fail for lack of capacity:

- **Prefetch HBM direct**: before inserting admitted keys into `DynamicEmbStorage`.
- **Cache write-back**: before writing evicted keys back to storage (only `DynamicEmbStorage` uses cache mode; `HybridStorage` does not).
- **Generic forward (DEFAULT mode)**: before `storage.insert()` when using `DynamicEmbStorage` or `HybridStorage` (for the latter, only the host tier is expanded).
- **HybridStorage.load**: before inserting keys evicted from HBM into the host tier.

**Trigger conditions:**

- **Non–NO_EVICTION**: When `max_load_factor` would be exceeded or (if set) at `max_capacity`, the table(s) that need it are doubled. See `init_capacity`, `max_load_factor`, `max_capacity` in `DynamicEmbTableOptions`.
- **NO_EVICTION**: The option `max_load_factor` is not used. The key_index_map is sized and expanded with a fixed effective max load factor of **0.5** (key_index_map capacity = ceil(init_capacity/0.5) at creation; expansion when `needed > table_rows` or `needed > key_index_map.capacity(table_id)`). Both the key_index_map and the embedding buffer are doubled for the affected table(s).


## Dump/Load and Incremental dump

Dump/Load and incremental dump is different from general module in PyTorch, because dynamicemb's underlying implementation is a hash table instead of a dense `torch.Tensor`.

So dynamicemb provides dedicated interface to load/save models' states, and provide conditional dump to support online training.

Please see `DynamicEmbDump`, `DynamicEmbLoad`, `incremental_dump` in [APIs Doc](./DynamicEmb_APIs.md) for more information.

## Deterministic mode

When handling cache eviction and final table eviction, dynamicemb encounters randomness in the eviction of keys with the same score. To eliminate this uncertainty, dynamicemb provides a deterministic mode. Enabling this mode ensures that, under the same training script, the evicted keys will be determined.
This mode is enabled by setting the environment variable `DEMB_DETERMINISM_MODE`.
