    """
    Enumeration for different modes of checking dynamic embedding's insertion behaviors.
    DynamicEmb uses a hashtable as the backend. If the embedding table capacity is small and the number of indices in a single lookup is large,
    it is easy for too many indices to be allocated to the same hash table bucket in one lookup, resulting in the inability to insert indices into the hashtable.
    DynamicEmb resolves this issue by setting the lookup results of indices that cannot be inserted to 0.
    Fortunately, in a hashtable with a large capacity, such insertion failures are very rare and almost never occur.
    This issue is more frequent in hashtables with small capacities, which can affect training accuracy.
    Therefore, we do not recommend using dynamic embedding tables for very small embedding tables.

    To prevent this behavior from affecting training without user awareness, DynamicEmb provides a safe check mode.
    Users can set whether to enable safe check when configuring DynamicEmbTableOptions.
    Enabling safe check will add some overhead, but it can provide insights into whether the hash table frequently fails to insert indices.
    If the number of insertion failures is high and the proportion of affected indices is large,
    it is recommended to either increase the dynamic embedding capacity or avoid using dynamic embedding tables for small embedding tables.

class DynamicEmbTableOptions:
    """
    Encapsulates the configuration options for dynamic embedding table.

    This class includes parameters that control the behavior and performance of the embedding lookup module, specifically tailored for dynamic embeddings.
    `get_grouped_key` will return fields used to group dynamic embedding tables.

    Fields listed first (through ``device_id``) are often filled by the planner or runtime rather than
    being the main user configuration knobs. Score handling for the hash table follows score
    policies and kernels, not a separate score-dtype field on this dataclass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    embedding_dtype : Optional[torch.dtype], optional
        Data (weight) type of dynamic embedding table.
    dim : Optional[int], optional
        Value vector dimension. With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``, ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options``
        sets it from ``BaseEmbeddingConfig.embedding_dim``. The embedding kernel only warns if it
        differs from the sharded ``local_cols`` (see ``_get_dynamicemb_options_per_table``).
    max_capacity : Optional[int], optional
        Per-shard maximum table rows on one GPU. With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``,
        ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options`` sets ``max_capacity`` to
        per-rank row count from :func:`get_sharded_table_capacity`.
        If ``init_capacity`` is unset it becomes ``max_capacity``; if set and aligned,
        it is clamped to at most ``max_capacity``.
        The embedding kernel checks consistency with TorchREC shard metadata (see
        ``_get_dynamicemb_options_per_table``).
    evict_strategy : DynamicEmbEvictStrategy
        Strategy used for evicting entries when the table exceeds its capacity.
        Default is :attr:`DynamicEmbEvictStrategy.LRU`.
    local_hbm_for_values : int
        High-bandwidth memory allocated for local values, in bytes. Default is 0.
        With ``DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner``, this is set to
        ``ceil(global_hbm_for_values / world_size)`` per rank.
    device_id : Optional[int], optional
        CUDA device index.
    training: bool
        Flag to indicate dynamic embedding tables is working on training mode or evaluation mode, default to `True`.
        If in training mode. **dynamicemb** stores embeddings and optimizer states together in the underlying key-value table. e.g.
        ```python
        key:torch.int64
        value = torch.concat(embedding, opt_states, dim=1)
        ```
        Therefore, if `training=True` the module allocates memory for optimizer states; the per-row state size follows the ``optimizer`` entry in ``fused_params`` (FBGEMM ``EmbOptimType``), as used by :class:`~dynamicemb.batched_dynamicemb_tables.BatchedDynamicEmbeddingTablesV2`.
    initializer_args : DynamicEmbInitializerArgs
        Arguments for initializing dynamic embedding vector values when training, and default using uniform distribution.
        For ``UNIFORM`` and ``TRUNCATED_NORMAL``, ``lower`` and ``upper`` default to
        ``±1/sqrt(N)`` where ``N`` is ``EmbeddingConfig.num_embeddings``.
    eval_initializer_args: DynamicEmbInitializerArgs
        The initializer args for evaluation mode, and will return torch.zeros(...) as embedding by default if index/sparse feature is missing.
    caching: bool
        Flag to indicate dynamic embedding tables is working on caching mode, default to `False`.
        When the device memory on a single GPU is insufficient to accommodate a single shard of the dynamic embedding table,
            dynamicemb supports the mixed use of device memory and host memory(pinned memory).
        But by default, the values of the entire table are concatenated with device memory and host memory.
        This means that the storage location of one embedding is determined by `hash_function(key)`, and mapping to device memory will bring better lookup performance.
        However, sparse features in training are often with temporal locality.
        In order to store hot keys in device memory, dynamicemb creates two table instances,
            whose values are stored in device memory and host memory respectively, and store hot keys on the GPU table priorily.
        If the GPU table is full, the evicted keys will be inserted into the host table.
        If the host table is also full, the key will be evicted(all the eviction is based on the score per key).
        The original intention of eviction is based on this insight: features that only appear once should not occupy memory(even host memory) for a long time.
        In short:
            set **`caching=True`** will create a GPU table and a host table, and make GPU table serves as a cache;
            set **`caching=False`** will create a hybrid table which use GPU and host memory in a concatenated way to store value.
            All keys and other meta data are always stored on GPU for both cases.
    init_capacity : Optional[int], optional
        The initial capacity of the table. If not set, it defaults to max_capacity after sharding.
        If `init_capacity` is provided, it will serve as the initial table capacity on a single GPU.
        With :class:`~dynamicemb.planner.planner.DynamicEmbeddingShardingPlanner`, it is rounded up
        to a multiple of the effective ``bucket_capacity`` in ``_prepare_dynemb_table_options``,
        then capped at ``max_capacity`` if the aligned value is larger.
        As the `load_factor` of the table increases, its capacity will gradually double (rehash) until it reaches `max_capacity`.
        Rehash will be done implicitly.
        Note: This is the setting for a single table at each rank.
    max_load_factor : float
        The maximum load factor before rehashing occurs. Default is 0.5.
        In NO_EVICTION mode, this option is ignored; the implementation uses
        a fixed effective max load factor of 0.5 for the key_index_map.
    score_strategy(DynamicEmbScoreStrategy or Tuple[DynamicEmbScoreStrategy, ...]):
        dynamicemb gives each key-value pair a score to represent its importance.
        Once there is insufficient space, the key-value pair will be evicted based on the score.
        The `score_strategy` is used to configure how to set the scores for keys in each batch.
        Default to DynamicEmbScoreStrategy.TIMESTAMP.
        For the multi-GPUs scenario of model parallelism, every rank's score_strategy should keep the same for one table,
            as they are the same table, but stored on different ranks.
        A *compound* score strategy may be given as a tuple. The ``TIMESTAMP`` element
        provides a per-key last-access timestamp column used by ``incremental_dump``,
        while the other element drives eviction ranking. The tuple form keeps the
        interface open for future combinations; only
        ``(DynamicEmbScoreStrategy.TIMESTAMP, DynamicEmbScoreStrategy.LFU)`` (in either
        order) is supported for now. It ranks eviction by an LFU access count while ALSO
        storing a last-access timestamp (compound ``LruLfu`` policy: two score words per
        key) so that keys touched since the last dump can be selected by a time-based
        ``incremental_dump``; it costs an extra 8 bytes/key. The tuple order is the
        *logical* order that checkpoints are written in (the on-device layout is fixed);
        both orders behave identically at runtime and differ only in checkpoint column
        order. A one-element tuple ``(X,)`` is treated as the single strategy ``X``.
        Note: only score strategies that include ``TIMESTAMP`` produce a time-based
        ``incremental_dump`` (items whose last-access time crosses the threshold). For
        strategies without a timestamp column, ``incremental_dump`` instead thresholds
        on the absolute score value.
    bucket_capacity : int
        Capacity of each bucket in the hash table, and default is 128 (using 1024 when the table serves as cache).
        A key will only be mapped to one bucket.
        When the bucket is full, the key with the smallest score in the bucket will be evicted, and its slot will be used to store a new key.
        The larger the bucket capacity, the more accurate the score based eviction will be, but it will also result in performance loss.
    safe_check_mode : DynamicEmbCheckMode
        Used to check if all keys in the current batch have been successfully inserted into the table.
        Should dynamic embedding table insert safe check be enabled? By default, it is disabled.
        Please refer to the API documentation for DynamicEmbCheckMode for more information.
    global_hbm_for_values : int
        Total GPU memory allocated to store embedding + optimizer states, in bytes. Default is 0.
        It has different meanings under `caching=True` and  `caching=False`.
            When `caching=False`, it decides how much GPU memory is in the total memory to store value in a single hybrid table.
            When `caching=True`, it decides the table capacity of the GPU table.
    external_storage: Storage
        The external storage/ParamterServer which inherits the interface of Storage, and can be configured per table.
        If not provided, will using DynamicEmbeddingTable as the Storage.
    index_type : Optional[torch.dtype], optional
        Index type of sparse features, will be set to DEFAULT_INDEX_TYPE(torch.int64) by default.
    dist_type : str
        Input distribution policy for row-wise sharding. Supported values are
        ``continuous``, ``roundrobin``, and ``hash_roundrobin``. Defaults to
        ``roundrobin``.
    admit_strategy : Optional[AdmissionStrategy], optional
        Admission strategy for controlling which keys are allowed to enter the embedding table.
        If provided, only keys that meet the strategy's criteria will be inserted into the table.
        Keys that don't meet the criteria will still be initialized and used in the forward pass,
        but won't be stored in the table. Default is None (all keys are admitted).
    admission_counter : Optional[Counter], optional
        Counter for tracking the number of keys that have been admitted to the embedding table.
        If provided, the counter will be used to track the number of keys that have been admitted to the embedding table.
        Default is None (no counter is used).
