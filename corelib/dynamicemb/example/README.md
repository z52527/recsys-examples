# Dynamicemb Example Introduction

In short, **dynamicemb** provides distributed, high-performance dynamic embedding storage and related functions for training.

How to run:
```shell
export NGPU=1
bash ./run_example.sh
```

- The [example.py](./example.py) will show you how to train and evaluate the embedding module, as well as dump, load and incremental dump the module, and this example also demonstrates how to customize embedding admissions.


- For detailed explanations of specific APIs and parameters, please refer to [API Doc](../DynamicEmb_APIs.md).

- For usage of external storage, Refer to demo `PyDictStorage` in [uint test](../test/test_batched_dynamic_embedding_tables_v2.py).

***dynamicemb** supports not only `EmbeddingCollection` but also `EmbeddingBagCollection`. However, due to the requirements of generative recommendations, dynamicemb focuses on performance optimization of `EmbeddingCollection` while providing full functional support for `EmbeddingBagCollection`. And we use `EmbeddingCollection` as an example.*
