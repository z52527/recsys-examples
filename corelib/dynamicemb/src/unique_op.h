/**
 * @brief Segmented unique operation that deduplicates keys per table.
 *
 * This function performs unique operation on keys partitioned by table_ids.
 * Keys are deduplicated within each table independently, allowing the same key
 * to appear in different tables. Uses compound hashing on (key, table_id) pairs
 * with a single shared hash table for memory efficiency.
 *
 * NOTE: This function is fully asynchronous with no GPU-CPU synchronization.
 *
 * @param keys Input keys tensor (int64 or uint64)
 * @param table_ids Table ID for each key (int64, same length as keys,
 *                  must be in ascending order)
 * @param num_tables Total number of tables
 * @param input_frequencies Controls frequency counting behavior:
 *                          - Undefined/empty tensor with numel()==0: Enable
 *                            frequency counting with each occurrence counted as
 * 1
 *                          - Tensor with numel()==num_keys: Use provided
 *                            frequencies for weighted counting
 *                          - Pass None from Python to disable frequency
 * counting entirely (output freq_counters will be empty)
 *
 * @return Tuple of (num_uniques, unique_keys, output_indices, table_offsets,
 *         freq_counters)
 *         - num_uniques: Tensor of size 1 containing total unique count
 *           (view of table_offsets[num_tables])
 *         - unique_keys: Compacted unique keys with size=num_keys (same as
 *           input). Only first num_uniques elements are valid.
 *         - output_indices: Index mapping (input idx -> global unique idx)
 *         - table_offsets: Tensor of size (num_tables + 1) with cumulative
 *           counts.
 *         - freq_counters: Frequency counts per unique key. Empty if frequency
 *           counting is disabled (input_frequencies was None).
