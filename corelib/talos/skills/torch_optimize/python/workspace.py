    python3 -m talos.torch_optimize.python.workspace init [--root DIR]

Creates the run-local ``.torch_optimize/`` workspace that the Main Loop
Agent, the Optimizer, and the Judge all read and write during a run; its
layout is described in ``workspace_layout.md``. Safe to re-run: if a
``.torch_optimize/`` already exists it is renamed to a timestamped backup
first — a fresh run never inherits or silently overwrites a prior one's
state, and nothing is ever deleted.
