# HSTU Inference benchmark

We provide a set of benchmarks for HSTU Inference on end-to-end inference and paged HSTU inference layer.


## How to run the benchmark

```bash
~$ cd recsys-examples/examples/hstu
~$ export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:$(realpath ../)
~$ python3 ./inference/benchmark/inference_benchmark.py
~$ python3 ./inference/benchmark/paged_hstu_with_kvcache_benchmark.py
```

## Benchmark results

Here we present the benchmark results of the HSTU layers with KV cache on single L20 gpu.

HSTU Setup for benchmark:

| Parameter                   | Value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| Number of HSTU layers       | 8     |
| Hidden Dim Size             | 1024  |
| Number of Heads             | 4     |
| Head Dim Size               | 256   |
| Max Batchsize               | 16    |
| Max Per Sequence Length     | 4096  |
| Per Sequence Targets Number | 256   |

Notice: This config is for all following benchmarks (unless otherwise specified).

### 1. End-to-end inference performance

Here we benchmarked with a synthetic input dataset:

* Each user's input sequence starts from 256 tokens to 4096 in increments of 256.
* Each input request has 256 item candidates for ranking.
* Generate data for 1, 2, 4 and 8 users to benchmark with different batch size. 

We can achieve **1.3x ~ 2.6x** performance speedup for inference (with batch size ranging from 1 to 8), after utilizing the KV cache and CUDA graph optimization.

Performance results:

Note:

1. The baseline performance is based on our implementation without KVCache support and CUDA Graph optimization.
2. The end-to-end performance includes the embedding part, which utilizes both native `EmbeddingCollection` from TorchRec and `DynamicEmbedding`.
3. The number of input sequences from the synthetic dataset increases according to the batch size. All test cases have 16 batches in total.
4. In the test cases with KVCache enabled, the kvcache preparation and onloading/offloading are within time measurement, but they are hidden as asynchronous operations. 

### 2. HSTU block performance

* **Performance Results on L20:**

When the input sequence has 4096 tokens in which 3968 tokens have KV data cached, we can achieve on HSTU block a speedup of **3x ~ 20x** without candidate items, and a speedup of **3x ~ 8x** with extra 256 candidates for each sequence (for batch size = 1 and 8 respectively).

Notice: In the L20 benchmark, the page size of KVCache is 32-token. The head dim of hstu attention kernel is 256. 

* **Performance Results on B200 (using HSTU Blackwell CuteDSL kernel):**

When the input sequence has 4096 tokens in which 3968 tokens have KV data cached, we can achieve on HSTU block a speedup of **3.3 ~ 7.7x** with extra 256 candidates for each sequence (for batch size = 1 and 8 respectively).

Notice: In the B200 benchmark, the page size of KVCache is 128-token. The head dim of hstu attention kernel is 128. This is limited by current kernel implementations.

### 3. HSTU model (training version) performance with Torch C++ Runtime

Benchmark results are measured in the model [exporting script](../export_inference_gr_ranking.py).
Here we present the benchmark results on the evaluation dataset **Kuairand-1k**.

* **Performance Results with Torch C++ Runtime:**

| Hardware   | Python Runtime E2E Time (s) | C++ Runtime E2E Time (s) | Speedup    |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| L20        |   1.755                     | 1.079                    | **1.63x**  |
| L40        |   1.416                     | 0.850                    | **1.66x**  |
| L40S       |   1.340                     | 0.704                    | **1.90x**  |
