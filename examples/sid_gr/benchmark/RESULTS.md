# Benchmark results: `generate()` vs `generate_beam_decode()`

Hardware: **NVIDIA H100 PCIe** (114 SMs).
Container: recsys-examples Docker (torch 2.11.0a0+nv26, CUDA 13).
Branch: `fea-mask-beam-search` (SID-GR + Jerry's `beam_decode_attn` kernel).
Date: 2026-05-09 (re-run with jagged-native option and phase breakdown).

## ⚠️ Correctness preconditions

These speedup numbers compare the **corrected** `generate()` baseline against
`generate_beam_decode()`. Both paths now implement beam-isolated attention:
- `generate()` builds `padded_target_aware_causal_mask` per step and feeds
  it through the jagged FA path (the `528cf77` regression has been fixed).
- `generate_beam_decode()` uses Jerry's `beam_decode_attn` with
  `topk_indices` for the same isolation.

The speedup is therefore an apples-to-apples comparison of two
mathematically equivalent implementations — not a comparison of "correct
new path vs broken baseline".

**Required local kernel patches** (in our `gr-decode_atten/interface.py`
clone, not yet upstream):
1. K1 accepts a `seqused_k` kwarg for variable-length history padding.
   Required by the default `use_jagged_kv=False` path. Filed upstream
   as MR-A on `runchuz/gr-decode_atten:feat/seqused-k`.
2. `BeamDecodeAttn.forward` forces `num_splits=1` when `seqused_k` is set
   (workaround for split-KV + seqused_k hang on SM90). Bundled with
   patch (1).
3. K1 accepts a `cu_seqlens_k` kwarg for jagged context K/V. Only
   required when `use_jagged_kv=True`. Filed upstream as MR-B on
   `runchuz/gr-decode_atten:feat/cu-seqlens-k-jagged-context` (built
   on top of MR-A).

If you re-install `quack-kernels` from PyPI without re-cloning
`gr-decode_atten`, the patches stay (they live in the local clone). If
you re-clone `gr-decode_atten` from upstream, the patches must be
re-applied.

`generate_beam_decode` runs a `inspect.signature` capability probe at
entry: if you pick `use_jagged_kv=True` but the installed
`beam_decode_attn` does not accept `cu_seqlens_k`, you get a clear
``RuntimeError`` instead of a confusing ``TypeError`` deep in the
decode loop.

## Setup

Both paths share the same model weights (`use_jagged_flash_attn=True`).
- **Original (`generate()`)** — re-runs the full transformer over
  `[history + all_generated]` per hierarchy step, with a beam-isolating
  arbitrary mask (built directly via `build_jagged_target_aware_arbitrary_func`).
- **New (`generate_beam_decode()`)** — prefill once → context KV cache;
  per-step decode reuses cached context KV and accumulates beam KV via
  `topk_indices` (Jerry's CuTe kernel, 3-kernel backend).

Median latency (ms) over 10 iterations after 3 warmup runs;
`cuda.synchronize()` before/after each iteration.

## Summary

> ⚠️ **The 24-config table below is a *small-model micro-benchmark*
> (B=4, hidden=256, layers=2). It severely under-states the algorithmic
> win.** A separate production-scale sweep (B=16, hidden=512, layers=8,
> hierarchies=4) below shows speedup growing from ~2× at hist=256 to
> ~12× at hist=1024 because `generate()` is O(hist²) while
> `generate_beam_decode` is O(hist). For most readers, the
> [Production-scale results](#production-scale-results) section is the
> right number to take away.

**Small-model bench** (B=4, hidden=256, layers=2, hierarchies=3):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Configs tested | 24 (4 hist_len × 3 beam_w × 2 dtypes) |
| Speedup range | 1.31× – 1.43× |
| Speedup median | **1.38×** |
| Phase split | prefill ≈ 3.0 ms, decode_loop ≈ 5.7 ms |

**Production-scale bench** (B=16, hidden=512, layers=8, hierarchies=4):

| hist_len | beam_w | speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 256  | 10–20 | **~2.1×** |
| 512  | 10–20 | **~4.7×** |
| 1024 | 10–20 | **~11–12×** |

The speedup grows roughly linearly with `hist_len` because `generate()`
re-runs attention over `[history + generated]` at every hierarchy step
(O(hist²) total work for the attention matmul) while
`generate_beam_decode` runs prefill once (O(hist) work) and the decode
loop's K1 attention also scales O(hist) per step. Doubling `hist`
roughly doubles the relative win.

`generate_beam_decode` is consistently faster across all configurations
and both dtypes. Speedup sits tightly around 1.35–1.40× — the workload
is dominated by the FFN/MLP and embedding-table lookup that both paths
share; the attention savings show up but don't dominate.

## Production-scale results

Run on the same H100 PCIe (2026-05-09) with a config closer to a real
SID-GR production setup:

Fixed: `batch=16, hierarchies=4, hidden=512, heads=8, kv_channels=64, layers=8, codebook=256`.

Key observations:

- **`decode_loop` is hist-independent** at ~15 ms across all configs.
  Once prefill is done, attention into the cached context K/V is O(hist)
  per K1 launch but kernel time is dominated by the dense projections
  and MLP; the K/V access is a small fraction.
- **`prefill` scales linearly with hist** (6.5 → 13 → 30 ms), as
  expected for a single FA pass over `[history + BOS]`.
- **`generate()` scales super-linearly with hist** (45 → 130 → 494 ms).
  It runs `num_hierarchies = 4` full transformer forward passes, each
  over a sequence that grows with `hist + generated_so_far`. The
  attention matmul is O(hist²) per pass; with 4 passes the relative
  cost grows fast.
- **Speedup grows roughly linearly with hist**: 2× → 5× → 12× as hist
  doubles from 256 to 1024. At realistic active-user history lengths
  (≥1K items), the win is an order of magnitude.

The `decode_loop ≈ 15 ms` plateau is the next perf target if
`generate_beam_decode` becomes a hot path: the bulk of it is per-step
QKV/MLP projections (8 layers × 3 decode steps × small B*W tokens).
That's a different optimization domain (small-batch dense ops, possible
CUDA-graph capture, or fusing layer-stack into one launch) — out of
scope for this MR.

## Observations

### Speedup is workload-stable

The speedup ratio sits tightly in 1.31–1.43× across:
- 4 history lengths (32, 64, 128, 256 — note this counts items; the
  actual transformer seqlen is `3 × hist_len + 1` because each item is
  3 SIDs and we add a BOS).
- 3 beam widths (4, 10, 20).
- 2 dtypes (bf16, fp16).

Earlier expectations (longer hist → more savings; bigger beam → more
savings) don't show up strongly — the dominant cost in this small model
is **FFN/MLP and embedding lookup**, not attention.

### Phase breakdown

- **Prefill**: ~3 ms regardless of config. This is the cost of running
  history+BOS through the transformer once, including jiayus FA + MLP/FFN
  + KV-cache materialisation.
- **Decode loop**: ~5.7 ms regardless of config. This is the cost of
  `(num_hierarchies − 1)` decode iterations, each containing: KJT lookup,
  layer-stack of `beam_decode_attn` calls, MLP, log_softmax,
  `beam_search.propagate`.

Both phases scale poorly with hist_len/beam_w because per-iteration
overhead (KJT roundtrip, MLP) dominates over the kernel time.

### Where the speedup comes from

The original `generate()` re-runs the full transformer over
`[history + all_generated]` at every hierarchy step, with a dense
arbitrary mask to isolate beams. For `num_hierarchies=3`, that's 3 forward
passes over a sequence growing each step.

`generate_beam_decode()` does:
1. **One** prefill over `[history + BOS]`.
2. **`num_hierarchies − 1`** lightweight decode steps, each processing
   only `beam_width` tokens (per layer) via the sparse `beam_decode_attn`
   kernel.

The savings come from not re-attending to the full history each step.

### dtype: bf16 vs fp16

No meaningful difference in either path — the H100 hardware is equally
happy with both for tensor-core ops. We test fp16 mainly to verify
correctness; numeric range is comparable for these SID-GR sizes.

### Backend choice: 3kernel vs dsl (kernel-level)

The model path defaults to `backend="3kernel"` because it's the only
backend that supports `seqused_k` (variable-length history). For
reference, a kernel-level micro-benchmark on H100 NVL (SM90, 2026-05)
at SID-GR shapes (B=4, Hq=Hkv=4, D=64, decode_nums=3) shows the fused
("dsl") path is ~1.46–1.49× faster per call across all measured
configs (hist∈{32,64,128,256}, W∈{4,10,20}, bf16/fp16): ~0.111 ms vs
~0.164 ms median.

End-to-end this only saves ~0.15 ms on a ~6.7 ms decode loop (<3 %);
prefill + dense projections dominate. `generate_beam_decode` accepts
`backend="dsl"` but enforces uniform history at runtime (the fused
path silently ignores `seqused_k`). On SM100 (B200) the kernel
internally auto-routes to 3kernel regardless of the `backend` arg.

### Jagged-native vs dense+seqused_k path (`use_jagged_kv` flag)

`generate_beam_decode` supports two ways of feeding the variable-length
context K/V to the K1 launch:

- **Dense + seqused_k** (default, `use_jagged_kv=False`): pad history to
  `[B, Sk_max, D]`, run prefill with FA's `causal=True` fast path,
  pass dense K/V plus `seqused_k` to K1 so pad positions are masked out.
- **Jagged-native** (`use_jagged_kv=True`): concatenate history into a
  flat `[total_tokens, D]` stream, run prefill with FA's `arbitrary=True`
  + a jagged-causal mask, feed jagged `[total_k, H, D]` K/V caches to K1
  with `cu_seqlens_k`. No padding is computed anywhere.

Phase-broken-down measurement on H100 PCIe (bf16, 12 configs, warmup=10
iter=50):

| Phase | Dense (B) | Jagged (C) | Δ (C - B) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Prefill | **2.18 ms** | **2.50 ms** | **+0.33 ms** |
| Decode loop | 4.14 ms | 4.10 ms | -0.04 ms |
| **Total** | **6.28 ms** | **6.60 ms** | **+0.32 ms** |

`B_ms / C_ms` median = **0.951×** — i.e. B (dense) takes 95.1% of the
wallclock that C (jagged) takes, so dense is the faster path by ~5% on
these shapes. Top-1 SIDs match exactly
across both paths; log-prob delta is ~0.012 (bf16 reduction-order noise,
well below the 0.15 regression threshold).

**Why dense wins on these shapes:**

- The K1 attention is only ~5% of decode loop time; saving its pad
  positions (~50% of K1 compute, i.e. ~2.5% of decode) gives ~0.04 ms.
- FA's `causal=True` is a heavily-optimized fast path; the jagged path
  uses `arbitrary=True` which adds `build_block_sparsity` CSR kernels
  (~0.15 ms) and slightly slower per-block indexing (~0.13 ms) plus
  arbitrary_func construction (~0.05 ms).
- Net: prefill overhead +0.33 ms eats up the +0.04 ms K1 saving.

**When jagged would win** (extrapolation, not measured):

| Shape | Δprefill (est) | Δdecode (est) | Net |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| current bench (hist≤256) | +0.33 ms | -0.04 ms | dense wins ~5% |
| medium (hist=512) | +0.4 ms | -0.2 ms | dense still wins |
| long (hist=2048, active users) | +0.6 ms | -1.0 ms | jagged wins ~5% |
| very long (hist=8192) | +1.0 ms | -4 ms | jagged wins ~15% |

Crossover point is roughly `hist >= 1000` items based on K1 scaling as
O(B·W·Sk·D) while prefill setup overhead is roughly Sk-independent.
This matches active-user history lengths in real SID-GR datasets
(KuaiRand, ml-1m 99-percentile), but typical training/eval truncates
history to under 512, so the default stays `use_jagged_kv=False`.

## Correctness verification

Three tiers of correctness signal, in order of strength:

1. **Reference oracle** (`TestReferenceOracle::test_kernel_vs_reference`,
   12 cases): the CuTe kernel output is compared against a pure-PyTorch
   reference implementation in fp32 using FA-style tolerance
   (`max_diff < 0.05`). This is the strongest mathematical check.

2. **Mask isolation unit tests** (`TestBeamIsolationMask`): direct check
   on `padded_target_aware_causal_mask` geometry — different beam
   regions are mutually invisible, all targets see all history.

3. **End-to-end regression guard**
   (`test_generate_vs_generate_beam_decode_regression_guard`): runs both
   paths with identical model weights and asserts:
   - top-1 SID per sample matches exactly,
   - per-position `|log_prob delta| < 0.15`,
   - top-K beam SID set overlap ≥ 70%.

   This is a regression GUARD, not a mathematical equivalence proof.
   bf16 attention's per-layer rounding plus beam-search's topk decision
   boundary make bit-exact equivalence impossible; the thresholds catch
   significant divergence.

## How to reproduce

**Production-scale results table** (recommended; this is the realistic
end-to-end win):

```bash
cd examples/sid_gr
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnccl.so.2 \
  PYTHONPATH=$REPO/examples:$KERNEL_PATH \
  torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 --master_port 29504 \
  benchmark/benchmark_beam_decode.py \
  --sweep --batch_size 16 --num_hierarchies 4 --num_layers 8 \
  --hidden_size 512 --num_heads 8 --kv_channels 64 \
  --sweep_hist 256,512,1024 --sweep_beam 10,20 --sweep_dtype bf16
```

**Small-model micro-bench** (the 24-config sweep at the bottom; mostly
useful for smoke-testing the integration end-to-end):

```bash
cd examples/sid_gr
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnccl.so.2 \
  PYTHONPATH=$REPO/examples:$KERNEL_PATH \
  torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 --master_port 29504 \
  benchmark/benchmark_beam_decode.py \
  --sweep --sweep_hist 32,64,128,256 --sweep_beam 4,10,20 --sweep_dtype bf16,fp16
```

The dense-vs-jagged 3-way comparison (the `Jagged-native vs
dense+seqused_k path` table above):

```bash
cd examples/sid_gr
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnccl.so.2 \
  PYTHONPATH=$REPO/examples:$KERNEL_PATH \
  torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 --master_port 29504 \
  benchmark/benchmark_beam_decode.py \
  --compare_kv_modes --sweep_hist 32,64,128,256 --sweep_beam 4,10,20 \
  --sweep_dtype bf16 --num_warmup 10 --num_iter 50
```

`--compare_kv_modes` requires the `cu_seqlens_k` patch in
`gr-decode_atten/interface.py` (MR-B) for the jagged column; the
benchmark probes for it and raises a clear error if it's missing.

## Known issues

- **Local kernel patches are not upstream** in `quack-kernels`: see the
  preconditions section. Documented in
  `corelib/.../docker_env_setup.md`-style memory.
- **Split-KV + `seqused_k`**: hangs in the K1 kernel; worked around by
  forcing `num_splits=1` when `seqused_k` is set.
- **Non-uniform `beam_widths`**: the kernel asserts uniform widths via
  `k_beam.shape[1] == decode_nums * beam_width`.
  `SIDGRModel.generate_beam_decode` validates uniformity at entry and
  rejects non-uniform lists; `BeamSearch` itself accepts non-uniform
  widths so other consumers can use them. The math in
  `build_beam_topk_indices` is general (cumulative offsets), so the
  BeamSearch side is ready if/when the kernel grows non-uniform support.
